Before you re-install or upgrade ILO:
The ILO installation script replaces packages in an existing installation. This
means that any custom code you have added to those packages will be lost when you
re-install or upgrade ILO. If you have added custom code, please save your code changes
for re-implementation before installing this version of ILO.

**********************************************************************************************

To modify the ILO packages to record elapsed time:

1. Install the 2.3 ILO package from http://method-r.com/software/ilo 

2. Store this set of scripts in a separate directory from the original package.  (You may want to
   refer to the orginal code later.)

   You must have write permissions to this directory so that the install script can write log files.
   
3. cd to the directory containing the modified scripts and start SQL*Plus session without connecting:

	sqlplus /nolog

4. From the SQL prompt in SQL*Plus:

	SQL> @ilo_et_install.sql

5. You will be prompted to enter the name and password of the ILO schema owner from the original 
   install.  The script will create an elapsed time table, an execution id sequence and recompile 
   both the ilo_task and ilo_timer packages.
